# Apify Web Scraper

## When to use

Use Apify when you need to extract data from websites, scrape social media profiles, run search engine queries, or automate web data collection workflows. Apify provides thousands of pre-built scrapers (called Actors) that handle common scraping tasks out of the box.

## Instructions

You have access to Apify tools for web scraping and data extraction.

### Key capabilities

- Use Apify Actors (pre-built scrapers) to extract data from websites
- Popular Actors: web-scraper, instagram-scraper, google-search-scraper, youtube-scraper, twitter-scraper, tiktok-scraper
- Each Actor has its own input schema -- check documentation before running

### Best practices

- Start with the simplest Actor that meets the need
- Use `maxItems` to limit results and avoid excessive costs
- Check Actor pricing before running (some have per-result costs)
- Parse results and extract only the fields you need
